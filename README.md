# Javascript AI Rock Paper Scissors

## Demo

The game can be played on GitHub by [clicking here](https://ozboware.github.io/Javascript-AI-Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

## Installation

**No installation**

Just open the index file in your browser to play.

## Controls

Click on your choice and wait for the computer to take its turn. I've slowed the time between player and computer choice to draw out the game a bit, but by modifying the timeout in the app.js script, you can control the length of time between plays.

The AI will remember patterns and make moves based on your historical moves.

Created using [brain.js](https://brain.js.org/) for the AI.
